"""Read and write FL Studio .flp project files, without FL Studio.

flpkit is a small, dependency-free library for the undocumented FLP format:

- **Reading**: ppq, tempo (modern and legacy events), channels (names + mix
  levels across four format generations), and notes per pattern/channel.
- **Writing**: raw byte surgery - patch or append exactly the bytes that
  express the change, never reserialize the whole file. FL Studio rejects
  whole-file reserialization by third-party writers (verified live 2026-08-27:
  a popular reverse-engineered serializer wrote a wrong FLhd channel count and
  mangled a text event; parsers read the corrupt file back happily while FL
  refused to load it). Every write here verifies itself by re-reading the
  saved file and field-matching the result.

Every constant below is a reverse-engineered fact carrying its evidence.
The facts were verified against real FL Studio 2026 (macOS) and a corpus of
164 FL-authored projects; the live verification harness lives in the parent
project, https://github.com/origami-research/fl-studio-mcp.
